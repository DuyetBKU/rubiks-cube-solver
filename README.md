## 🧩 What is this?

**Rubik's Cube Auto Solver 3D** is a web-based simulator that:
- 📷 Captures the current cube state
- 💡 Visualizes it in full 3D using `Three.js`
- 🤖 Solves it step-by-step using the **CFOP** algorithm
- 🌀 Allows scrambling, solving, pausing, and more — all inside your browser!

> ⚡ Perfect for learning algorithms, showing off, or integrating into teaching tools.

## ✨ Features

✅ Interactive 3D visualization  
✅ CFOP-based solving algorithm  
✅ Scramble generator  
✅ Auto-solve animation with speed control  
✅ Snapshot the current cube state (generates shareable link)  
✅ Real-time progress & step display  
✅ Built with `React`, `Three.js`, `Tailwind`, and deployed on `Vercel`
